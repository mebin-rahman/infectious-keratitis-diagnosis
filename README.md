This repository contains the code for diagnosing Infectious Keratitis (IK) using deep learning approach. The project is implemented using two Jupyter notebooks:

Healthy_VS_BK(model_1).ipynb: A deep learning model that classifies images into Healthy and Bacterial Keratitis (BK) categories.
Healthy_VS_BK_VS_FK(model_2).ipynb: A deep learning model that classifies images into Healthy, Bacterial Keratitis (BK) and Fungal Keratitis (FK) categories.

The following dependencies are required for running the notebooks and are listed in the requirements.txt file:

rawpy==0.20.0
pillow
numpy==1.23.5
matplotlib==3.9.1
imageio==2.31.6
torch
torchvision
